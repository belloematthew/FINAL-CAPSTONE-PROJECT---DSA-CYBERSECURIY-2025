FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL
Title: Building a Virtual Cybersecurity Laboratory and Conducting Android Forensics
Investigations

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
This ﬁnal project is designed to consolidate and demonstrate the practical knowledge
acquired
during the 3-month cybersecurity training program. Students will be expected to:
I. Set up a fully functional virtual cybersecurity lab
II. Analyze an Android forensic image and produce a professional investigation report
III. (Optional) Deploy a virtual ﬁrewall to simulate an enterprise-grade network security
Environment.

2. PROJECT SCOPE
Part I – Virtual Cybersecurity Lab Setup

Objective:
To simulate a secure, real-world environment for offensive and defensive security testing
through
virtual machines.

Activities: 
● Install a Type 2 hypervisor (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation/Player)
● Create and conﬁgure two virtual machines:
● Kali Linux (attacker environment)
● Microsoft Windows 7 or 10 (target environment)
● Establish internal virtual networking between VMs
● Verify connectivity via ping tests, shared directories, and service enumeration 

Minimum System Speciﬁcations (per VM):
RAM: 2 GB (minimum)
Storage: 20 GB
Processor: Dual-core or higher
Note: BIOS-level virtualization must be enabled for optimal performance.
Part II – Android Forensics Analysis and Reporting

Objective:
To analyze a provided Android forensic image and compile a formal digital investigation
report.

Resources Provided:
Android forensic image ﬁle (.zip or .img) containing mock digital evidence
Forensic tools (e.g., Autopsy)

Tasks:
Conduct forensic analysis of the Android image: 
● Extract and document:
● SMS messages, call logs, contact lists
● Application usage history
● Files, images, browser history, crypto wallets, deleted content
● Generate a comprehensive Forensics Investigation Report including:
● Methodology and tools used
● Screenshots and ﬁndings
● Conclusion and professional recommendations 

Part III – (Optional) Virtual Firewall Implementation

Objective:
To enhance the lab environment with a virtual ﬁrewall for trafﬁc inspection and
segmentation.

Tasks:
Create a virtual pfSense or OPNsense appliance Conﬁgure:
WAN and LAN interfaces
NAT, DHCP, and DNS as needed
Basic ﬁrewall rules (e.g., port ﬁltering)
Connect the Kali and Windows machines to route trafﬁc through the ﬁrewall
Test ﬁltering and logging functionality; document conﬁguration steps and output

3. DELIVERABLES
Each student must submit the following:
 
● Cyber Lab Documentation: Setup screenshots and descriptions
● Forensics Report (PDF):
● Toolset used
● Analysis methodology
● Extracted evidence and key ﬁndings
● Summary and recommendations
● (Optional) Firewall conﬁguration overview and test screenshots 

4. Expected Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the project, participants will be able to:
 
● Build and conﬁgure virtual cybersecurity testing environments
● Perform foundational mobile device forensics
● Document ﬁndings using industry-standard reporting practices
● (Optional) Understand and deploy basic ﬁrewall security in simulated enterprise 
networks
